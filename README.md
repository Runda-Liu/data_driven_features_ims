# Multiclass bearing fault classification using features learned by a deep neural network

This repository contains codes for the International Congress and Workshop on Industrial AI 2020 (IAI - 2020) paper that uses learned data-driven featuers from a deep neural network and SVM to interpret the features and for fault classification.
